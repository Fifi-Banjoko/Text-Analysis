Informatics 304: Programming for Informatics 
HW5

Total Points: 200
There are 5 problems, each worth 50 points, so you can complete any 4 for full credit (4x50=200), or more than 4 for extra credit. Most problems have extra credit options as well.

Each problem can be found in a separate Python file. If you do not want to run the code for a given problem, simply comment out that problem's function at the bottom of this file.

As before, each problem contains an initial print statement. Please leave that in place when solving the problem.

This assignment is based on Chapters 8, 9 and 7.11 section of Chapter 7 from the textbook. You might need to use more than one concept from these chapters to solve the problems.

NOTE: DO NOT change the function definitions given in each .py file, only add/modify the code inside the function definitions. Grading will be done on the basis of each function being written according to it's relevant description so you will lose points if a function definition is changed even if it works correctly.
